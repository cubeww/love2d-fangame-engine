# Love2D Fangame Engine - Alpha

An experimental **IWBTG Fangame engine**, aimed to be an alternative to gamemaker.

The engine is still under development, so there may be some bugs.

## Project structure

+ engine: Some scripts to maintain the running of the game (object-instance system, sprite, room...)
+ game: Elements used in the IWBTG fangame (World, Player, Levels...)
+ main.lua: Program entry

## Develop (Windows)

1. Clone / download the repository
2. Install love2d runner [LÃ–VE - Free 2D Game Engine (love2d.org)](https://love2d.org/)
3. (Recommend) Set the love2d installation path as an **environment variable**
4. (Recommend) Download and install vscode, and install the "Lua Language Server" extension (sumneko)
5. Open the repository folder with vscode and start developing.
6. Run 'lovec .' in the terminal to test the engine/game.
